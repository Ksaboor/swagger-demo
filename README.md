Geting practice understanding API documentation
Plan to implement it on to my personal project.


# What is Swagger? 
If you’ve ever worked with APIs, 
chances are, you’ve heard of Swagger. 
Swagger is the most widely used tooling ecosystem for 
developing APIs with the OpenAPI Specification (OAS). 
Swagger consists of both open source as well as 
professional tools, catering to almost every need and 
use case.    

# A Brief History Lesson 

Swagger used to consist of the specification and a large
ecosystem of tools to implement the specification. 
These tools include everything from front-end user interfaces, 
low-level code libraries and commercial API management 
solutions. In 2015, SmartBear Software donated 
the Swagger specification to the Linux Foundation, 
and renamed the specification to 
the OpenAPI Specification. 
SmartBear also became the founding member of 
the OpenAPI Initiative (OAI), a body to 
govern the development of the OAS in 
an open and transparent manner.
